The passengers are, in fact, people who have fulfilled their mission in life and are waiting for their turn to move to the afterlife.

<p>Being collective product of playwright Ramiz Heydar and Oktay Kazimi – “Gold Wedding” has been repeatedly performed on the scene of the Musical Theater and has always been met with interest. The reason for this is that the subject of the work is – elevated love and patriotism which are urgent for all periods and for all people. Even though episodes on the stages take place in Baku one of the heroes- Azar – who just leaned his name, gave a chance to the girl who he met recently, even the audience to memorize broken ties between generations. Azar came from France to search for his relatives in Azerbaijan where his father grow up and died. At the airport he falls in love with the guide girl being unaware of the identity of the girl and during whole trip he sees the city through her eyes, he visited the open-air Gobustan Museum which is one of the most spectacular historic museum of the world and it is full of with the historical monuments, he watched giant stones with amazement and interest.

<p><em>The Azerbaijani folk tale ""Cırtdan"" tells the story of a clever young boy named Cırtdan who saves children from a mythical creature, the Div. Cırtdan is one of the most beloved characters in Azerbaijani folklore. Many recall the tale of how Cırtdan and his friends spent a night in the Div's house. At midnight, the Div entered the room and asked, ""Who is asleep, who is awake?"" To which Cırtdan replied, ""Everyone is asleep, Cırtdan is awake."" This phrase has become a popular saying, and parents often jokingly refer to their children as ""Cırtdan.""</em></p>
<p><em>Our play is dedicated to this cherished character. But what adventures await Cırtdan in our story?</em></p>
<p><em>Cırtdan ventures into the forest to gather firewood with neighboring children. On their way back, they lose their way in the dark. Following a light they see in the distance, they arrive at the Div's house. At night, the Div attempts to lure the children to eat them.</em></p>

<p><em>Macbeth’s murder of Duncan becomes the point of no return. Evil always begets evil, gradually engulfing everything around it. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are forced to continue shedding blood to conceal their crimes. Ultimately, Macbeth’s ambition to become king leads to his downfall. He arrogantly misinterprets the witches’ prophecies, believing their promises of glory. He heard what he wanted to hear and believed what he wanted to believe. The guilt prevents them from fully enjoying the power they desired. This guilt continues to torment Lady Macbeth, driving both of them into madness and eventually to death under the judgment of Divine justice.</em></p>

<p><em>The life story of actor Feuerbach, who lives a turbulent life, takes place in an empty room without windows. His memories resemble a terrifying fairy tale. He strives to prove his true talent, to show that he is a genuine actor through the roles he creates. However, unexpected events often trap him in a labyrinth with no way out. Despite this, he keeps fighting, returning to work for the sake of beautiful art because he still has hope. But each time, someone destroys his hopes.</em></p>
<p><em>The indifference and misunderstanding of those around him push Feuerbach toward the staircase built on stage, which also symbolizes the last step of his life. Beyond this point, there is no road. Beyond this point, there is no life. Beyond this point, Feuerbach will no longer exist, and his suffering will come to an end.</em></p>
<p><em>The main message of this play, which tells the turbulent life of an unlucky actor, is to create bridges for talented people—bridges that will help them ascend toward greatness without stumbling in their fight for true art. Protecting talents is everyone's responsibility.</em></p>",2024-12-18T15:00:00.000000Z,2024-12-18T15:50:00.000000Z,True,10,10,['https://cdn.iticket.az/event/gallery/Q8GjtcfvwVfHE1gMmwz0Gv3EA6ZjatpqgK8XLx8J.jpg'],https://cdn.iticket.az/event/facebook/9A4AB6di52yqHXPaGeQbnx7gwdycPnEFerHW2y96.jpg,"Tankred Dorst.

<p><strong>""The Bride's Rock""</strong></p>
<p><strong>Act I</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene 1:</strong><br />The Khan of the hunters' region falls in love with a peasant girl, Gulbahar. To achieve his desire, he cuts off the village's water supply and sends Gulbahar's lover, Jamal, to the mountains to restore it. The villagers anxiously await the water and Jamal's return. Sanam, the Khan's chief wife, warns Gulbahar that yielding to the Khan's love would lead to misery. Gulbahar tries to conceal her feelings. Jamal returns with the water and learns of the Khan's intentions. He decides to confront the Khan.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2:</strong><br />Jamal, accompanied by his mother, meets the Khan and gifts him a tiger skin, requesting permission to marry Gulbahar. The Khan agrees but imposes a condition: the wedding must take place with a dress gifted by the Khan. Reluctantly, Jamal accepts the dress. During the wedding, the Khan sets a new condition: Jamal must leave immediately to hunt another tiger.</p>
<p><strong>Act II</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scene 1:</strong><br />At Jamal's wedding, the villagers celebrate joyfully. The Khan and Vizier arrive, demanding Jamal to leave at once for the second tiger skin.

<p><em>Based on motives from the tragedy by Huseyn Javid ""Iblis""</em></p>
<p><em>A philosophical-deconstructive metadrama</em></p>
<p><em>The beginning of the 20th century was a period of global social revolutions. It was during this time that the romantic mode of thinking emerged and strengthened in Azerbaijani literature.</em></p>
<p><em>The dramaturgy of Huseyn Javid, an Azerbaijani poet, writer, and playwright, and the founder and main representative of the literary movement of romanticism in Azerbaijani literature, was constructed not on fleeting plots and temporary conflicts, but on global, cosmic, and universal ideas. The dramas of Huseyn Javid, the brightest representative of Azerbaijani romanticism of the 20th century, created a new stage in Azerbaijani dramaturgy in terms of style, writing manner, and form innovation. His philosophical and historical tragedies had a powerful impact on the development of national theater culture, leading to the emergence and development of the ""Javid theater"".</em></p>
<p><em>The theme of IBLIS, explored and attracting attention both in the West and the East, was uniquely resolved by Huseyn Javid within the concept of God. Huseyn Javid presented the concept of Man, Iblis, and God in his distinctive form. His thoughts on Man, Iblis, and God are a significant internal force and essence of his work. This play can be called a deconstruction based on Huseyn Javid's work ""Iblis"". Based on the motives of the play ""Iblis"" - ""Iblis and..."".</em></p>
<p><em>The line of intent in the four-act tragedy (one-act metadrama in deconstruction) changes and focuses solely on the God-Iblis and man line. The intent is directed towards Iblis, and the resultant factor is directed towards Man. In short, the play ""Iblis"" depicts the fate of people who have sold their souls to the devil. This is the victory of IBLIS.</em></p>
<p><em>At first glance, the seed of DOUBT in the dark world of Arif, a philosopher drowning in the injustice of the world, his hidden desire for power and wealth, and the restless spirit of an Eastern man leave him in a dilemma between the life he desires and the life he lives.</em></p>
<p><em>A person with emptiness inside attracts IBLIS. And Iblis proves to God that he is right in his struggle with man, who caused his exile to Earth.</em></p>",2024-12-19T15:00:00.000000Z,2024-12-22T16:30:00.000000Z,True,25,10,['https://cdn.iticket.az/event/gallery/72BR9iW4YFN8AG97eWswJsT9zMIjVAv8Lwx626Nr.jpg'],https://cdn.iticket.az/event/facebook/b1LIvpPxey5Q26JtDti0G0Hc7d5wDCNnJE8yma13.jpg,"IBLIS and...

<p><em>Beloved by theaters worldwide, Beaumarchais's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" was first staged in Azerbaijan in 1940 at the Academic National Drama Theatre. The Azerbaijan State National Young Spectators Theatre has revisited this play 83 years later, including it in the 2024 repertoire.</em></p>
<p><em>This comedy, with its intriguing plot, features Count Almaviva, who lustfully eyes all women around him and seeks to disrupt Suzanne and Figaro's wedding.</em></p>
<p><em>The conflict between the Count and Figaro in the play is rich with comic nuances. Suzanne, Figaro, and the Countess set a trap for the wayward Count. The Count, using his own cunning, hopes to expose the Countess's infidelity. However, his trick fails, and he is embarrassed to find Suzanne emerging from behind the door.</em></p>
<p><em>Count Almaviva's servant Figaro and his fiancée, along with other accomplice servants, prove to be smarter and more resourceful than their masters. They skillfully overcome all obstacles.</em></p>
<p><em>Eventually, the Count, looking forward to meeting Suzanne, waits for her in his garden. The Countess, dressed in Suzanne's clothes, goes to meet the Count. The Count is confused when he sees the Countess instead of Suzanne and asks for her forgiveness. The Countess forgives him. Suzanne, in the Countess's clothes, goes to meet Figaro. Figaro, initially anxious, recognizes Suzanne in the unfamiliar dress and regrets his wrongful thoughts about his beloved.</em></p>
<p><em>In this farcical play, the music of famous composers Mozart and Rossini is used.</em></p>

Frightened by this, Shah Abbas summons a council and instructs his ministers to find a way to avert this calamity. When no one can find a solution, Shah Abbas orders the execution of the astrologer. However, Zaman Khan argues that carrying out the order will not help, as the calamity will take the astrologer’s life with it. The Shah then retracts his order and asks the astrologer for a solution. The astrologer replies that, indeed, after seven days, disaster will befall the Safavid dynasty, and to prevent it, the Shah must be replaced by a fake ruler.
